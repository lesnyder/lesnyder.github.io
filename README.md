## Lauren Elizabeth Snyder

I'm a fourth year PhD Candidate in [Biomedical and Health Informatics at the University of Washington](http://bime.uw.edu/) and my research examines design standards and usability evaluation of information visualizations for global health preparedness. I have designed/developed/evaluated information visualizations for a wide range of public health topics, including HIV, health policy, opioid use, vaccination coverage, and body mass index surviellance.

When I'm not working, I love to hike, travel, and cook new recipes. I also have a plant addiction and have a small rainforest in my PNW home.
